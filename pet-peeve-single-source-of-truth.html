                <h1>Pet Peeve - Single Source of Truth</h1>
<p>Take a moment to consider the meaning of the following adage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This adage is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segal%27s_law">Segal's law</a>. On its surface, it seems to advocate that a single source of truth (i.e. only one method for determining time) allows for certainty, whereas having multiple measurements will lead to uncertainty. A deeper reading is that the man with only one watch is overconfident in the time; adding a new watch adds (rather than removes) information. In this case, the additional information was a measure of how much watches differ. The man with two watches is actually in a better position: he has an estimate of the time <em>and</em> its uncertainty, whereas the first man doesn't know what the uncertainty is.</p>
<p>Having a <strong>single source of truth</strong> is important in a lot of software engineering applications, but isn't necessarily desirable in data science.</p>
<h2>When to have a single source of truth</h2>
<p>To design robust software, it is important to have a single source of truth about the state the application is in. If there are multiple sources of truth, it is possible for different parts of the application to not recieve updates, and show inconsistent information. To make this a little more concrete, imagine an online shopping cart. When you put an item into a cart:
- the button displaying "X items in cart" has to know how many things are in the cart.
- the checkout page has to know what is in your cart
- the tax calculation component has to know what is in your cart, and where it is being sent
- the delivery componnet has to know whether anything in your cart has delivery exceptions</p>
<p>You could imagine a developer trying to be "efficient" and only tell the button component to add one when things are added to the cart, and remove one when things are removed. Why duplicate the entire cart if all we want to know is the count? Problems can occur if a page is refreshed because the connection was slow (so some components get the message twice, others get it only on the refresh) and things become slowly out of sync. Your page says you have 5 items in your cart, but when you click on the checkout page there are only three things in the list.</p>
<p>The single source of truth approach to this problem is that there is one shopping cart for your user (the source of truth). The button component has to ask the shopping cart "how many items do you have?" and displays that, overriding whatever it had before. It doesn't try and manually track changes. Similarly all the other pieces of the e-commerce website ask the <em>same</em> shopping cart application for the information they need before displaying their output to the user. We can still have ambiguities (e.g. page refreshes) but at least our entire app will agree whether we added the item twice or not.</p>
<p>That last point is worth emphasizing. As a software engineer, you want to respect the users expectations. If they click a button, something should happen. If they change a dropdown, it should stay changed. However, if information does get lost or scrambled, it is important to remain consistent. If the user tries to change the dropdown to a new choice, but packets get dropped, it is better to reset the dropbox to what the application thinks it should be. Software engineers have a single source of truth to <em>define</em> the state of the system.</p>
<h2>When to NOT have a single source of truth</h2>
<p>A data scientist's job is different. She is trying to make a measurement about the world, while the software engineer is trying to make a self-consistent state of the world. A key part of making a measurement is knowing the uncertainty associated with it. The more expensive changes from an analysis are, the more confident we would want to be about the size of the benefit. Knowing that opening a new factory is predicted to bring in another $10M of profit isn't as useful as knowing that the prediction is $10M &pm; $1M (or $10M &pm; $20M!).</p>
<p>Where a single source of truth <em>does</em> make sense for a data science team is when talking about definitions. When asking whether a user churned, what does this mean? Does it mean the user hasn't logged on for 7 days? 14 days? What if they visited the page, but no longer made any purchases? If you break your users churn rate down by age bracket, do you use the age when they joined, or the age when they churned? </p>
<p>Having these definitions centralized helps people communicate more effectively, as two data scientists talking about user churn can be confident that they are talking about the same thing. It allows consistent tracking of a metric to help assess the impact of different decisions.</p>
<p>It does make sense to go back and address these definitions periodically. In a technical sense, a definition cannot be <em>wrong</em>, but it might be of limited use (or even harmful). It might be worth changing the definition of churn so that users that come from a search engine, and don't click on any links within the page, are not counted as a visit as they are not engaging with the community. Perhaps the appropriate thing to do would be to make an "engagement" metric to measure this instead. If people coming in and bouncing didn't used to be a big component of your traffic, but it is growing, changing the definition of churn can be a way of trying to make the metric "measure the same thing".</p>
<p>Controlling the metrics is important, because the metrics shape the discussion that occurs (and even the decisions made). If you think that a definition should never be changed, and instead we should just define a new metric, I'd encourage you to look at <a href="/changing_definitions.html">this article</a></p>
<h3>Proxies</h3>
<p>Often times we are not able to find the features we actually want, so we use proxies -- features we <em>can</em> find that we believe are highly correlated with the features we want but cannot get. For example, we might not know what the income-level of a client is, but we know thier shipping address. From data about property prices, and census data, we can use their location to estimate the income-level, but it is only approximate. Maybe this person is sharing the house with multiple flatmates. Maybe this person inherited the house. On an individual level, our proxies might be wrong, but (if it is a good proxy) it will be a good estimate in aggregate.</p>
<p>If we have <em>multiple</em> independent proxies for the feature we want, then we are more confident when all our proxies tell us the same thing. Having an "ensemble" of proxies allows many of the same benefits that having an ensemble of models does: special cases may violate some of our proxies, but are unlikely to violate most of them. Taking multiple proxies is the opposite for having a "single source of truth" - instead we have multiple measures to allow us to estimate the unobtainable feature, as well as a degree of uncertainty. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Any measurement that isn't just counting has an uncertainty attached, and even measurements that <em>are</em> just counting are often ways of estimating other parameters. If measuring the effectiveness of an ad, there might not be any uncertainty in the number of times the ad was shown, or the number of times it was clicked, but we generally want to estimate the effectiveness of the ad on the population as a whole (not just a historic recounting of how many clicks it actually had). The estimate of the ads click-through rate has an uncertainty. In practice, things like ad-blockers mean that we are not even certain about the underlying counts. This uncertainty ins't just an annoyance; it is a critical part of the measurement and should be taken into consideration when making a decision.</p>
<p>The idea of a single source of truth comes from software engineering, where it is used to ensure that our application is in one consistent state. In data science, we want to ensure we have one precise metric that we are targeting, but can allow some differences in how different analyses craft their features. Particularly when using proxies, the more independent measures we have, the better idea we have of the underlying feature's value (or at least our confidence in it). </p>
